 # Description: This program attempts to optimize a users portfolio using the Efficient Frontier & Python.
A program to optimize a stock portfolio using the efficient frontier & Python ! In modern portfolio theory, the efficient frontier is an investment portfolio which occupies the ‘efficient’ parts of the risk-return spectrum. Formally, it is the set of portfolios which satisfy the condition that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but with the same standard deviation of return.
The Sharpe Ratio goes further: it actually helps you find the best possible proportion of these stocks to use, in a portfolio.
